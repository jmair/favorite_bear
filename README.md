##Favorite Bear

1. Yes, I frequent sites such as frontendmasters.com, egghead.io, and udemy.com to fill in any gaps and to bring myself up to speed. My latest interest has been in Reactive programming and utilizing frameworks like Rx.js to handle user events.

2. Semantic HTML5 means that you use the right tag in the right place to more accurately describe the page layout and the data on the page. Meaning that you don't use tags just for presentational concerns.

3. I was very impressed with Angular when it first came out and came up to speed quickly with Angular 1.0. For the past 2 years I've been working almost exclusively in React along with Node and Express.

4. Yes, most recently I've come up to speed with CSS Grid and Flexbox.

5. Yes, my favorites are map, reduce and filter.

6. Inline flows items next to each other as one letter in text does to another. Block elements take up the full width of the screen not allowing adjacent elements. Inline-block allows elements to flow inline together while retaining the box model of a block element allowing block properties such as margin and padding.

7. There is static which is the default flow, relative which retains the original space where the element would be in the static flow but draws the element reletive to that space. Absolute takes the element out of the static flow completely and places it in the nearest parent element that has either relative or absolute positioning.

8. There is the function declaration and the function expression. Function declarations get hoisted which may prove beneficial for that reason, but can also cause confusion. Function expressions are more versatile and more explicit as well as practical since you can access the function through the variable and pass it around easily.

9. JavaScript is a Prototypal language so is atypical of most object oriented languages in that sense. It has a prototypal chain meaning that all functions have a \__proto\__ property that links to another parent function. If the current function cannot fulfill the invocation of the method then JavaScript looks up the prototype chain for a function that can.

class Instrument {} 

class Guitar extends Instrument {}

10. I would think they would say that I can build most any layout in CSS and do it in an way that is easy to maintain and understand.

11. Yes, I would make it as generic as possible and have it fulfill a single task. Making it modular and dynamic.
